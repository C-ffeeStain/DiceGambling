# Dice Gambling
This is a simple python game in which you 'roll dice' to get a certain number, which may earn you a reward depending on which number you get. It is based on the shop gambling minigame from [Spelunky 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/Spelunky_2/).
# Setup
Download the latest release from the [releases page](releases) and run setup.py with Python 3.9 or greater to set up the application.
